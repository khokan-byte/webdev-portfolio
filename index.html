            <p>The approach to goal setting isn’t fun, it isn’t meaningful, and it isn’t effective. Setting high-quality
                goals that will help us achieve the things we want requires focus. We need to know what we want if we’re
                going to get there, and that’s where we believe.

                <h3>mission</h3>
                <p>Every organization has a mission statement and it holds quite a significant place in the entire brand
                    and company architecture. Plus it provides the way forward for the top management and the key</p>

                <h3>vision</h3>
                <p>Having a vision places a purpose upon your goal-setting activities. Without an end goal or
                    destination in mind, then you won't have a clear or defined path. Vision provides this. To achieve
                    your vision or goal</p>

            <div id="goals"><img src="images/illustrators/illustrator-3.png" alt="">
                <h3>goals</h3>
                <p>Without a goal, your efforts can become disjointed and often confusing.
                    For example, a goal takes the flight of a hummingbird, which is chaotic and erratic and focuses it
                    much like a hawk swooping down for its prey.</p>
